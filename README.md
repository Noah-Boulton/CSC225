# CSC 225 - Algorithms and Data Structures I

Basic techniques for design, analysis, implementation of algorithms and data structures. 

## Foundations: 
Random access machine model, time and space complexity, worst-case analysis, upper and lower bounds. Proof techniques for algorithm correctness. 

## Basic data structures: 
Stacks, queues, linked lists. Sorting: elementary sorting algorithms, mergesort, quicksort, priority queues. 

## Searching: 
Binary search trees, balanced search trees, hash tables. Graphs: undirected and directed graphs, graph traversals and applications, topological sort. 

## Algorithm design techniques: 
Greedy, backtracking, divide and conquer.
