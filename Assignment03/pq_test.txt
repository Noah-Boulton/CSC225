Testing the ranGen, makeHeap, insert, and heapsort metohds.

Making a small heap of size 8.
Checking if the heap is sorted after heapsort: true

Making a small heap using the insert method.
Checking if the heap is sorted after heapsort: true

Making a heap of size 100.
Checking if the heap is sorted after heapsort: true
Size of the array: 100
Comparisons for heapsort: 214

Making a heap of size 1000.
Checking if the heap is sorted after heapsort: true
Size of the array: 1000
Comparisons for heapsort: 3782

Making a heap of size 10000.
Checking if the heap is sorted after heapsort: true
Size of the array: 10000
Comparisons for heapsort: 53766

Testing the deleteMin method. Making two equal heaps, sorting one
and repeatedly deleting the min of the other.
The deleteMin method should return the same sorted sequence as heapsort.
The sequences are the same: true

Testing the efficiency of the heapsort method
by tracking the number of comparisons relative to the size of the heap.
